# v0

This API version is not yet stable. Do not use this version as a protection against API change.

## What is it?

max's API is versioned.

This means as the API is improved over time we will not break your code.

The latest version will be pulled into the max namespace. That way you may chose to use the latest version and be notified via compiler errors when the API changes.

But if instead you prefer to upgrade when you are ready, you can use a specific version. In the case of v0, this is in the namespace max::v0.

However, **v0 is not yet stable**. It is likely to change.
