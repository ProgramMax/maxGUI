## Deprecation Schedule

We know transitioning a codebase to a new technology takes time. And we know customers may still be on an old OS.

In order to ease transition pressure, max will continue to provide support for 5 years after a replacement is available.

As an example, when a new version of Clang comes out you will have 5 years to migrate off the now-old version.

You can reference the full [deprecation schedule](DeprecationSchedule.md) for exact dates.
