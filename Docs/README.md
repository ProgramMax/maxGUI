# maxGUI

maxGUI allows for easy, light-weight, and cross-platform* GUI coding.

[![Build and test](https://github.com/ProgramMax/maxGUI/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ProgramMax/maxGUI/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yaml)

If maxGUI is missing a feature you need, submit a [feature request](https://github.com/ProgramMax/maxGUI/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=).

## Examples

Start with the [simple example](https://github.com/ProgramMax/maxGUI/blob/master/Code/Examples/1%20-%20SimpleExample/EntryPoint.cpp). It shows the basics in an easy-to-follow way.

If you would like maxGUI to support more contacts us and let us know.

## Migration

If your project already has GUI code, you can read the [migration docs](Migration.md) for help migrating to maxGUI.

## Deprecation Schedule

We know transitioning a codebase to a new technology takes time. And we know customers may still be on an old OS.

In order to ease transition pressure, maxGUI will continue to provide support for 5 years after a replacement is available.

As an example, when a new version of Clang comes out you will have 5 years to migrate off the now-old version.

You can reference the full [deprecation schedule](DeprecationSchedule.md) for exact dates.

## Dependencies

maxGUI depends on [max](https://github.com/ProgramMax/max), which also has a [BSD 3-Clause license](https://github.com/ProgramMax/max/blob/master/LICENSE).
You can find some parts of max under [Dependencies/max](https://github.com/ProgramMax/maxGUI/blob/master/Dependencies/max).
